        Infers Group was set up in 2015 as a knowledge management company that connects
        societies and knowledge producers/institutions to communicate, engage and establish each other’s
        relevance for better participation in knowledge economies in Africa.

        The company operated through its Gaborone and Cape Town offices to bring together Africa’s brilliant
        minds, creating ecosystems that allow the ambition of knowledge economies to become reality.

        In 2018 Infers Group re-thought its strategy to become proactive by participating in management and
        coordination of networks and information to awaken talents, imagination, and lifelong learning in
        knowledge economies.
        The strategy is designed to facilitate networks that cross-pollinate new ideas and practices to catalyse new forms of entrepreneurship through Africa’s unique cultural
        capital.

        The organisation has developed a network-centric strategy that will enable enterprises to traject
        into businesses capable of transitioning Botswana into a knowledge based economy facilitated by
        effectively managed projects, intellectual property, economies of scale, monitoring and evaluation
        and advanced services, and linking knowledge producers in all sectors with policy, business
        community, the public and various community groups to advance a Botswana economy that is
        translatable into SADC and global markets.
